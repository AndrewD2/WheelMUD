WheelMUD
========
C# MUD framework.

## Overview
WheelMUD is a framework for creating Multiple-User Dimensions (MUDs) using the .NET 4.0 platform and the C# language. Being built on modern tools and techniques, WheelMUD will allow MUD administrators to build their world and customize the code far easier than the MUDs of yesteryear.

## Big News
March 2015:
* This site (github) is becoming the new primary site for WheelMUD source, documentation, and issue tracking (for now; may consider applying for free Jira Cloud services).
* Archived Discussions have migrated to [muds.gamedev.com](http://muds.gamedev.com). Please use that site for public discussions which are not issue-related or pull-request-related.

## Project Information
There is lots of information about WheelMUD, and [Documentation](Documentation/README.md) for WheelMUD, available right here in the source tree.
Get started at the [Documentation](Documentation/README.md) root, where you will find things ranging from the [Project Goals](Documentation/ProjectGoals.md) to [Development](Documentation/Development/README.md)-oriented information.
