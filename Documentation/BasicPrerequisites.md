# Basic Prerequisites for WheelMUD

## Supported Operating Systems
Most recent Windows environments should be able to run WheelMUD. The following have been explicitly reported as working without any code changes:
* Windows XP (at least with SP2 and SP3)
* Windows Vista (including SP1 and SP2)
* Windows 7
* Windows 2003 Server (including R2)
* Windows 2008 Server (including R2)
Others (such as Windows 8) should work; let us know how it goes in the [muds.gamedev.com](http://muds.gamedev.com) forums if you try another operating system.

## Supported Development Environments
Currently we are focusing on supporting one solution file, for use with Visual Studio 2013.
(The free, full-featured Visual Studio Community 2013 edition, is a good way to go. Editions like ultimate and professional will work as well, if you happen to have them.)
The solution will likely continue working in paid VS2010 editions as well (although not supported).
Solution files may exist for MonoDevelop, SharpDevelop, and a VS2010 Express solution (because that edition did not support solution folders); however, these are no longer supported by the core WheelMUD team. You are welcome to repair and commit updates for these, if you need them.
