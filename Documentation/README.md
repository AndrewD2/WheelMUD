WheelMUD Documentation
======================
This is the root page for WheelMUD documentation.

## Project Information
Parties interested in WheelMUD, including non-developers, may find these topics of interest:
* [Project Goals](../master/Documentation/ProjectGoals.md)
* [Project History](../master/Documentation/ProjectHistory.md)
* [High Level Road Map](../master/Documentation/RoadMap.md)
* [Participation](../master/Documentation/Participation.md)
* [Getting Started](../master/Documentation/GettingStarted.md)
* [Optional Configuration](../master/Documentation/Configuration.md)

## Development
There are already lots of resources for developers, so we've housed all other [Development](../master/Documentation/Development/README.md) information in the [Development](../master/Documentation/Development/README.md) section.

## Design
There will be a lot of design resources being migrated here soon, so we've prepared a space for [Design](../master/Documentation/Design/README.md) documents.
