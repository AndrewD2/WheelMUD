WheelMUD Documentation
======================
This is the root page for WheelMUD documentation.

## Project Information
Parties interested in WheelMUD, including non-developers, may find these topics of interest:
* [Project Goals](Documentation/ProjectGoals.md)
* [Project History](Documentation/ProjectHistory.md)
* [High Level Road Map](Documentation/RoadMap.md)
* [Participation](Documentation/Participation.md)
* [Getting Started](Documentation/GettingStarted.md)
* [Optional Configuration](Documentation/Configuration.md)

## Development
There are already lots of resources for developers, so we've housed all other [Development](Documentation/Development/README.md) information in the [Development](Documentation/Development/README.md) section.

## Design
There will be a lot of design resources being migrated here soon, so we've prepared a space for [Design](Documentation/Design/README.md) documents.
